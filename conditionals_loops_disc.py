# Conditionals & Loops Discussion ! :)

# Quick refresher: 

# This is the syntax of a for-loop:
# for variable in range(start, stop, step):
    # Code block to be executed

# This is the syntax of a while-loop:
# while condition == true:
    # Code block to be executed

# Note: It is normal to forget the syntax! That is why google is your bff and you just need to google "for loop syntax" or "while loop syntax"
# There are also tons of resources. I usually just go to images to quickly check the syntax. 
# Remember to cite where you got your code from if you are borrowing a block of code. 





'''Problem 1: Your turn!
Print i 10 times using both a for and while loop.'''

'''Problem 2: Conditionals
Think of all the ways you can compare a number, x, with a value, 10. Write a function that will take in a value of x and compare it with 10.'''

'''Problem 3: Range()
Range is a cool function but there are a lot of parts to it so let's disect it!
What happens if the range is from (5, 5)? How about from (10, 6)?
Try different step sizes: (10, 6, -1), (1, 10, 2). Write down all your observations
and answer the following questions.'''
